# AliasPtr â€“ (mostly) safe shared pointers in Rust

The `alias-ptr` crate supplies the `AliasPtr` type, which allows safely creating multiple pointers to the same heap-allocated memory, and (unsafely) freeing the memory without reference counting overhead.

The `AliasPtr` type is a pointer whose API is modeled after `Rc` or `Arc` (providing shared `Deref` access to its target). Unlike them, `AliasPtr` expects the user to delete the target manually (an `unsafe` operation). This is designed to work like C++'s raw pointers, which allow aliased access to underlying data, as well as manually freeing/deleting memory.

This is not designed to replace usage of Rust's safe abstractions like Box, but to serve as a fallback where multiple ownership is necessary (and cannot be easily worked around) but the overhead of Rc or Arc is undesired. The intended use is to use `AliasPtr` within your data structures as if it were a `Rc`, carefully audit your unsafe `Drop` logic to ensure you never use-after-free, and expose a safe API to users.

For example, `AliasPtr` can be used to replace `owning-ref`'s usage of a `Box` aliased with a `*const` (which is unsound under Stacked Borrows, fails Miri, and may miscompile once rustc enables noalias for mutable pointers).

## Install

`alias-ptr` is planned to be published at https://lib.rs/alias-ptr.

## Usage

TODO

## Design

AliasPtr holds raw pointers rather than references (since Miri prohibits passing references into `Box::from_raw()`), and lends out shared references whenever dereferenced.

## Testing

AliasPtr is designed to be sound under Stacked Borrows, pass Miri with Stacked Borrows enabled, and not miscompile once rustc enables mutable noalias.

To verify it passes Miri, run:

```
cargo +nightly miri test --target-dir miri
```

Note that this clobbers the "miri" subdirectory.
